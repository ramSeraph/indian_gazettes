All the code here has been migrated to [ramSeraph/egazette](https://github.com/ramSeraph/egazette) and data has been uploaded to the [gazetteofindia](https://archive.org/details/gazetteofindia) collection on Internet Archive.

==============


Contains code to scrape Indian state gazettes

Some of the urls were obtained from the central gazette site at https://egazette.gov.in

Feel free to add an issue if you find other sources.

Ideally this data should go into https://archive.org/details/gazetteofindia

Other known projects with similar aims:

* https://github.com/sushant354/egazette
* https://github.com/DigitalIndiaArchiver/TNGazette
* https://github.com/captn3m0/uk-gazette-archive

I see this as a temp location to put code and data in, not the final destination.
